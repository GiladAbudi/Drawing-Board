# Drawing-Board
A user who enters a page that is at a specific URL will be able to draw different elements on the page. (For example: Square, Circle, Triangle, and so on) Another user who enters the same address can view the same drawing created by the previous user, and can also add their own elements to the drawing.

You can log in to the page at any time (even after several days / server reboot) and see all the elements created by the different users of the page.

The administrator can set a maximum number of elements that a user can create per day.


Extras:
1. Deleting Elements - Only by the user who created the board.
2. If a group of users wants their own private page, they can do so by adding a character sequence to the URL.
For example, users who log on to www.myboard.com/group1 will see a completely different board than people who log on to www.myboard.com/group2.
3. Page interactive update - The page will be updated in real time when adding elements by other users.
4. The administrator can delete elements on any page.
